Angela Mia, you are my angel dear
And heaven sent you down to me from up above

Angela mia, you are my guiding star
A sweet Madonna that I honor and I love

You're like the sunshine in all its splendor
And I surrender each time you smile

Angela mia, my prayers are answered now
And I am thankful for Angela mia, mia
