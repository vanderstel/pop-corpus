The moon was all aglow and heaven was in your eyes
The night that you told me those little white lies
The stars all seemed to know that you didn't mean all those sighs
The night that you told me those little white lies

I try but there's no forgetting when evening appears
I sigh but there's no regretting in spite of my tears
The devil was in your heart but heaven was in your eye
The night that you told me those little white lies
